# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an HTML code repository located at `/Users/lax/Documents/Laxman/htmlCode`. The repository is currently empty and not initialized as a Git repository.

## Getting Started

Since this is a fresh repository, you may need to:
1. Initialize Git if version control is needed: `git init`
2. Create initial HTML files, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files as needed
3. Set up any build tools or package managers depending on the project requirements

## Common File Structure

When HTML projects are created in this repository, they typically include:
- `index.html` - Main entry point
- `css/` - Stylesheets directory  
- `js/` - JavaScript files directory
- `assets/` or `images/` - Static assets

## Development Workflow

For HTML projects, common development tasks include:
- Opening HTML files directly in a browser for preview
- Using a local development server if needed (e.g., Python's `python -m http.server` or Node's `npx serve`)
- Validating HTML markup
- Optimizing assets and minifying code for production

## Notes

This repository is not currently a Git repository. Consider running `git init` to enable version control if needed for the project.
